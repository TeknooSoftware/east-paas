  without all credentials and keys data

    And a composer hook as hook builder
    And an image builder
    And a cluster client
    And A consumer Account "fooBar"
    And a project on this account "fooBar Project" with the id "projectid"
    And a cluster "behat-cluster" dedicated to the environment "prod"
    And a repository on the url "https://github.com/foo/bar"
    And a job with the id "jobid" at date "2018-01-01 00:00:00 UTC"
